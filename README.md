## What is it?

NoReboot is a simple script that will attempt to disable Windows automatic reboot function after updates are complete. This allows systems that need to be up when expected to stay on and avoid reboots until a proper update window can be achieved.

## How do I use it?

Simply download the .exe or build the .go file and run it as an administrator. If NoReboot is already enabled it will prompt to remove it, otherwise it will prompt to install it. Simple
